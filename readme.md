# Personal layout

This is my personal layout for the niu mini. It uses 4 different layers (base, lower, raise, adjust). Much of the features are a combination of different layouts and designs such as the planck but also the signum 3 by Troy Fetcher.

For an overview of the layout see [this](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/681891570020fad2fdec17477216f398)

## Features

- all normal keys and characters (I personally use an almost completely custom xkb layout, it could be that without it some characters are missing on ISO layouts duo to the missing key ANSI boards have that I had to accomodate previously with the xkb layout)
- arrow keys
- F1 to F12
- Page Up, Page Down, Insert, Delete, ...
- Mouse support
- Numberpad
- LED integration (normal backlighting but also showing the state of the keyboard when "Info Toggle" is on; **partially implemented**)
- MacOS and Linux layouts (minor differences; requires software mapping of F20 to the apple fn key (which is pretty much [proprietary](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/2179); this is a work around))

## LED setup (WIP)
